# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    Answer: The sample quality is likely moderately representative but may have limitations. Using an online platform like SurveyMonkey allows access to a diverse range of participants across age groups, which significantly supports the study's representativeness. However, several factors could introduce bias, such as unequal internet access among older age groups or varying familiarity with online surveys. Additionally, those who participate may have a pre-existing interest in music, which could skew results. Despite the stratified sampling method, achieving perfect representativeness is challenging due to these practical constraints.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    Implemented changes:
- Included an introduction explaining the survey's purpose, assuring anonymity, and asking for consent to address ethical considerations
- Added a neutral option like "I appreciate different aspects of music from then and now" in question 7 to capture more nuanced opinions
- Allowed participants to select multiple choices in questions 3, 5, and 10 Â to reflect the complexity of preferences.
- Added an option for "I'm not sure" if participants don't track their listening hours.
- Swapped questions 7 and 8 to avoid irrelevant questions and keep logic flowing: if someone selects "Never" for Question 7 (listening to new music), skip Question 8.
- Updated Question 5 with additional variants 'Other places (please specify, e.g., public transport, cafes, etc.)'

    Survey Introduction:
 Thank you for your invaluable participation in this survey! Your input is crucial in helping us understand how age influences music tastes, particularly perceptions of popular music. Your responses will shape our understanding of how music preferences differ across age groups and evolve over time.
 Your participation is voluntary, and all responses will be kept confidential. Your information will be used solely for research purposes and will not be shared with third parties.
 By proceeding with this survey, you confirm that you are 18 or older and agree to participate in this research study. If you have any questions or concerns, please get in touch with the survey administrator.
 This survey has been designed to be as efficient as possible and will take approximately 5â€“10 minutes to complete. We respect your time and appreciate your valuable insights.
 Thank you for your time and valuable insights!
 Please read each question carefully and select the best option for your opinion or experience.

 1. What is your age? Â 18-25 | 26-35 | 36-45 | 46-55 | 56-65 | 66-75 | 76+
 2. How often do you listen to music? Every day | Several times a week | Once a week | Less often
 3. What genres of music do you enjoy the most? (select all that apply)Â Pop | Rock | Hip-Hop/Rap | Classical | Jazz | Country | Electronic | Other (please specify)
 4. How many hours a week do you usually spend listening to music? Less than 5 hours | 5-10 hours | 10-20 hours | More than 20 hours | I'm not sure
 5. Where do you usually listen to music? (select all that apply) In the car | At home (via headphones or speakers) | At work or school | Outside (via headphones) | At the gym or while working out | Other places (please specify, e.g., public transport, cafes, etc.)
 6. Do you feel that your taste in music has changed as you've aged? Â Yes, I now enjoy different genres/artists compared to when I was younger. | No, my music taste has remained the same. | I enjoy the same types of music more, but some preferences have changed.
 7. Do you actively listen to new popular music (e.g., charts, mainstream artists)? Â Yes, regularly | Occasionally | Rarely | Never
 8. How do you perceive the current popular music compared to the music from when you were younger? Â It is better now than before. | It is worse now than before. | It's about the same as before. | I appreciate different aspects of music from then and now | I'm not sure.
 9. Do you think age affects your perception of popular music? Yes | No | Not sure
 10. If your taste in music has changed with age, what has influenced this change? (select all that apply) Personal preferences | Influence of environment (friends, family) | Changes in life (work, family, etc.) | Media (TV, Internet)
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    Answer: The purpose of the survey could not be fully achieved through an observational study due to its inherent limitations in capturing subjective insights and personal reflections. These limitations necessitate the use of alternative research methods, such as surveys, to gain a comprehensive understanding of music preferences.

   - Subjective Preferences and Perceptions:
     Observational studies can reveal what people listen to but not why. Understanding perceptions of popular music or changes in taste over time requires asking participants about their thoughts and experiences, which is only possible through surveys. For example, a survey can uncover why a specific song holds personal meaning.
   - Changes Over Time:
     While observational data can show trends in music consumption across age groups, it cannot capture how individuals feel their preferences have evolved. Surveys provide the personal reflections necessary to understand these changes.
   - Influence of External Factors:
     Surveys are essential for examining how factors like environment, life changes, or media shape music preferences. Observational data lacks the context to explain whether trends, like increased classical music streaming among older adults, stem from personal growth, lifestyle changes, or cultural influences.
