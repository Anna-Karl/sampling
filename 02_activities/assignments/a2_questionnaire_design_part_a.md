# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
This survey explores how age influences music taste, specifically the perception of popular music, by comparing preferences across different age groups and examining how individual music tastes evolve over time.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Adults from various age groups from around the world, ranging from 18 to 80 years old, who include and represent diverse music tastes. 
Sampling Frame: A general public database using an online platform (SurveyMonkey) where a diverse group of individuals can be accessed for the survey.
Sampling Units: Individual participants who meet the age and demographic criteria.
Sampling Strategy: The stratified random sampling method ensures that all age groups will be equally represented in the study, allowing for the findings' credibility and reliability.
Observational units: demographic information (age group), listening frequency and preferences (genres, listening hours, places), changes in music taste over time, perception of current popular music, and engagement with popular music.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What is your age? Â 18-25 | 26-35 | 36-45 | 46-55 | 56-65 | 66-75 | 76+

6. Do you feel that your taste in music has changed as you've aged? Â Yes, I now enjoy different genres/artists compared to when I was younger. | No, my music taste has remained the same. | I enjoy the same types of music more, but some preferences have changed.
7. How do you perceive the current popular music compared to the music from when you were younger? Â It is better now than before. | It is worse now than before. | It's about the same as before. | I'm not sure.
8. Do you actively listen to new popular music (e.g., charts, mainstream artists)? Â Yes, regularly | Occasionally | Rarely | Never
9. Do you think age affects your perception of popular music? Yes | No | Not sure
10. If your taste in music has changed with age, what has influenced this change? Personal preferences | Influence of environment (friends, family) | Changes in life (work, family, etc.) | Media (TV, Internet)
