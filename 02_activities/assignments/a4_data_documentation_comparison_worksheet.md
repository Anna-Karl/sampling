|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample type                                           |Stratified random sampling involves grouping the population based on geography and demographics, followed by random selection within each group.|This sample is an online two-wave panel sample with a modified rolling cross-section design. It involves collecting data at two different points in timeâ€”during the campaign period and in a post-election recontact wave.|Purposive sampling: the study specifically focuses on Glossophaga soricina, a bat species. Convenience sampling: the researchers utilized a captive colony of bats and conducted field surveys where the species was accessible.|
| Sample size                                           |A field sample of approximately 50,000 units was used. Among them, about 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent to selected households across Canada. A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected.|Pre-election survey - 37,822 respondents. Post-election survey - 10,340 respondents.|112 G. soricina (73 females, 39 males) from which 38 faecal samples were obtained|
| Target population                                     |All  persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, as well as, full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.|Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.|Glossophaga soricina bats in Costa Rica |
| Sampling frame                                        |This survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address.|Online panels with targets stratified by region, gender, and age. |Specific geographical locations in Costa Rica where the wild bats were captured using mist nets|
| Survey mode(s)                                        |The electronic questionnaire and through CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing). |The online survey was presented on the Qualtrics online platform.|Field observations, laboratory experiments ( DNA barcoding, acoustic modeling).|
| Timeline                                              |The data was collected from September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018; released January 26, 2021|Campaign Period Survey: September 13th to October 21st, 2019. Post-election survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019.|7-week period from late May to early July 2009, lab records - 9 days|
| Response rate                                         |The overall response rate is 41.9%.|Traditional response rates not calculated; post-election re-interview rate was 27.3%|N/A                                                                                             |
| Weights                                               |The survey responses were weighted to ensure they represented the target population, with adjustments for income, geographic area, age, and sex. Variance estimation was conducted using bootstrap weights.|The data was weighted based on by province, gender, age, and education level|N/A                                                                                             |
| Data processing                                       |Processing used the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities (coding responses, verifying data for accuracy, editing responses for consistency, combining the data as it came in, identifying duplicates, eliminating non-responses etc) |Data cleaning involved removing incomplete responses, duplicates, speeders, straight liners, and those with postal code mismatches.|DNA barcoding of fecal samples, acoustic analysis of echolocation calls, and behavioral observations.                                                                                             |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |Donor imputation was used to fill missing values based on similar respondents, with mean imputation applied when donor data was unavailable. Income data was linked to tax records for respondents who consented to linkage. The GVP imputation process effectively completed incomplete responses by leveraging data from respondents with similar characteristics.|Duplicate responses and low-quality data (e.g., speeders, straight liners) were removed. Specific flags were used to identify inattentive respondents and initial duplicates. |Accurate recording and analysis of bat behavior and diet. Sequence editing and alignment; identification via DNA barcoding; synchronization of audio and video data                                                                                             |
| Sources of error                                      |Potential errors include sampling error, non-sampling error, coverage error, response error, processing error (misinterpretations of the questions and answers by both respondents and researchers and incorrectly entering answers).|Potential errors include sampling error, non-sampling error, coverage error (internet access required), and non-response bias, measurement errors|Potential errors include sampling bias, identification errors in DNA barcoding, and observer bias in behavioral experiments (incomplete reference database; captive bats may not represent wild behavior).                                                                                             |
| Limitations, known biases                             |The study faced limitations due to the exclusion of respondents from the 3 territories and households without telephones or with telephone services not covered by the frame|Coverage limitations include the exclusion of respondents from the territories and those not part of online panels. Traditional response rates couldn't be calculated, and potential underrepresentation of certain groups exists, especially due to the online-only sampling and biases from self-reported data.|The study was limited to specific areas and sample sizes, and behavioral observations may have been influenced by the lab setting. Insect identification was hindered by incomplete reference databases. Bats were sampled at one time and location, which may not be representative, and the captive bats used for echolocation were not representative of wild bats.                                                                                             |
